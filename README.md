# Simple Homepage

This small project is a single-file homepage with a blue gradient background, a circular-cropped profile image, a "Hello, world!" heading, and a "Contact me" button that currently does nothing.

Files created:

- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styles
- `assets/me.svg` — placeholder profile image (replace with your photo)

How to view

Open `index.html` in your browser (macOS):

```bash
open /Users/dwightslaptop/Desktop/my-homepage/index.html
```

Replace the profile photo

Put a photo named `me.jpg` or `me.png` into the `assets/` folder and update the `src` in `index.html` if desired. The image will be cropped to a circle using CSS. Recommended square image, at least 400×400 for best quality.
